package example.a99Outro

// - Kotlin has a complete documentation with examples,
//   provided by JetBrains, plus a large community(SO...)

// - Converting an old Java project into Kotlin?
//   Rather don't.
//   Broken non-null/null type semantics, and unexpected returned nulls/NPEs.

//  Q: "Hey, why did they put in [some nullability quirk?]"
//  A: Because of Java interop mess, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IhT8HACc2E

// Thing we didn't get to:
// - extensive out-of-the-box general-purpose tooling (think List.average() earlier)
// - coroutines, lambdas, delegated properties, inline functions...
