// --- Getting started with using kotlin ---
// - 2 versions of IntelliJ IDEA: Community and Ultimate
//   Ultimate is paid, you can use EAP(beta) version for free

// - Looking for something? Google(surprised?)
//   Kotlin has a complete documentation, provided by JetBrains

// - Syntax eluding you, frameworks difficult to use?
//   Get a set-up starting project and copypaste from there.

// - Converting an old Java project to Kotlin?
//   Don't, because of broken non-null/null type semantics,
//   And unexpected returned nulls/NPEs.
